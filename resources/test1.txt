Commonly assigned U.S. patent 5,546,951; U.S. patent application 08/793,371; and PCT application WO 96/05768, which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference, disclose methods for sensing an electrical property of heart tissue, for example, local activation time, as a function of the precise location within the heart. The data are acquired with one or more catheters that are advanced into the heart using catheters that have electrical and location sensors in their distal tips. Methods of creating a map of the electrical activity of the heart based on these data are disclosed in EP-A-0 974 936 and EP-A-1 070 430 which are also incorporated herein in their entirety by reference. As indicated in these applications, location and electrical activity is preferably initially measured on about 10 to about 20 points on the interior surface of the heart. These data points are then generally sufficient to generate a preliminary reconstruction or map of the cardiac surface to a satisfactory quality. The preliminary map is often combined with data taken at additional points in order to generate a more comprehensive map of the heart's electrical activity. In clinical settings, it is not uncommon to accumulate data at 100 or more sites to generate a detailed, comprehensive map of heart chamber electrical activity. The generated detailed map may then serve as the basis for deciding on a therapeutic course of action, for example, tissue ablation, to alter the propagation of the heart's electrical activity and to restore normal heart rhythm.
